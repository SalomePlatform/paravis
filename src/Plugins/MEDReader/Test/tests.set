# This file declares a shared set of MEDREADER tests, used by two test
# approaches: "make test" and "salome test". The former is used just after
# MEDREADER build step, the latter is used from an installed SALOME application.
#
# We here initialize a cmake variable that is used, by file inclusion, in
# CMakeLists.txt (for make test) and CTestTestfileInstall.cmake (for salome
# test).
# This variables is: TEST_NUMBERS.
# Additional variables might be defined if necessary.

# 11 and 12 have been willingly removed due to problem in image comparisons
