# This file declares a shared set of PARAVIS tests, used by two test
# approaches: "make test" and "salome test". The former is used just after
# PARAVIS build step, the latter is used from an installed SALOME application.
#
# We here initialize some cmake variables that are used, by file inclusion, in
# CMakeLists.txt (for make test) and CTestTestfileInstall.cmake (for salome
# test).
# These variables are: BASE_TESTS, EXTRA_TESTS and ALL_TESTS. The latter is
# the joint set of base and extra tests.
# Additional variables might be defined if necessary.
