Basic Installation
------------------

The build procedure of the SALOME platform is implemented with CMake.
In order to build the module you have to do the following actions: 

1. Set up environment for pre-requisites (see "Pre-requisites" section above).

2. Create a build directory:

   % mkdir PARAVIS_BUILD

3. Configure the build procedure:

   % cd PARAVIS_BUILD
   % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_directory> <path_to_src_dir>

   where
   - <mode> is either Release or Debug (default: Release);
   - <installation_directory> is a destination folder to install SALOME ParaVis
      module (default: /usr); 
   - <path_to_src_dir> is a path to the SALOME ParaVis sources directory.

   Note: by default (if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option is not given), SALOME ParaVis
   module will be configured for installation to the /usr directory that requires
   root permissions to complete the installation.

4. Build and install:

   % make
   % make install

   This will install SALOME ParaVis module to the <installation_directory>
   specified to cmake command on the previous step.
